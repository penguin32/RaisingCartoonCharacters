# RaisingCartoonCharacters
A very simple fan-made game.

2025, April 2
So grouping now is,
    object that is drawn on the floor, like, vomit,blood,carpet etc..
    takes negative values (shitTrails.lua)

group 0, walls,
group 1, walls, but for characters and other types, excluding camera
group 2, first object that I created I assigned that a value 2 (shit.lua)
