--Unique functions:
--(Functions only used here)
--example:
--	function Layer1:hangMyself(rope) --(only called inside this file)
--	end

--Special Functions:
--(looped in list of tables in LevelLoader, then only called on main.lua)
-- Functions below are called with the loops of LevelLoader, then that LevelLoader function will be called
-- on main.lua, this way is for compartmentalizing it within only a single if-statement or by having an ability
-- of disabling or enabling a specific functions globaly, which means it affects all other layers,
-- I have a feeling its necessary also to write these functions out, whether it has none.
-- these functions need to exist on each new layers to be created or else LevelLoader will throw an error for
-- a missing functions they loop through.

-- I think I don't have to write them everytime, if I'd just check the screening first,
-- screening(if-statements that looks for a specific layer before it loops through its functions
-- inside controls.lua and LevelLoader.lua(maybe)
-- but example of these non-mandatory functions are mousepressed and mousereleased, see controls.lua,
	-- that it loops through it to check what "layers" it is first, before calling it, thats why.

function Layer1:mousepressed(mx,my,btn) -- use in controls.lua
end

function Layer1:mousereleased(mx,my,btn)
end

function Layer1:updateScaling()
end

function Layer1:drawOutlines()
