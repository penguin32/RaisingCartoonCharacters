--Unique functions:
--(Functions only used here)

--	function Level1:hangMyself(rope) --(only called inside this file)

--Special Functions:
--(looped in list of tables in LevelLoader, then only called on main.lua)
-- Functions below are called with the loops of LevelLoader, then that LevelLoader function will be called
-- on main.lua, this way is for compartmentalizing it within only a single if-statement or by having an ability
-- of disabling or enabling a specific functions globaly, which means it affects all other levels,
-- I have a feeling its necessary also to write these functions out, whether it has none.
-- these functions need to exist on each new levels to be created or else LevelLoader will throw an error for
-- a missing functions they loop through.
